# Ground Construction

## Introduction

This mod allows you to build any vessel directly on a surface of any planet from a DIY (Do It Youself) Kit that contains all the high-tech components, needed equipment and blueprints, using only raw meterials produced on-site, energy and kerbal workforce.

## Features

* Build any ship, spaceplane, or really any construction you come up with in Editor.
* Build anywhere on the surface: the assembled ship will appear right where you've placed the Kit.
* No complex logistics, no special production parts required: all you need is an habitable compartment with enough space, raw materials and qulified kerbal personnel.
* Background operation: fly other missions while construction takes place on a far-away planet. Days, even weeks may be required to build something complex, but you don't have to babysit your workers.

## Requirements

* [ModuleManager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-121)
* [CommunityResourcePack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007-12)
* AT_Utils (already included)

## Downloads

* [**Spacedock**]() is the main download site for releases
* [GitHub](https://github.com/allista/GroundConstruction) have sources (MIT), assets (CCBY-4.0) and also releases
* CKAN is supported

## How it works

First, you need a simple mining operation already running near the spot where you want to build something. So you need: a Drill, an ISRU, some storage tanks for Ore, Metals and any other staff that you want/need to supply the newly built ship with; some space to work in (hitch-hickers can, science lab or a big passanger compartment will do; we'll call it the *Workshop*) and, last but not least, kerbal engineers that will build things.

Second, you need to assemble the DIY Kit with required materials (good luck with finding enough Blutonium for RTG on Minmus), tools and components. This is, fortunately, the simplest thing: in Editor you have a special part, namely the **DIY Kit Container**, which allows you to "load" any previously created and saved ship inside of it. The container is automatically resized to fit its contents, which are much more compact and weight much less than the original ship.

Third, you need to attach this container to a carrier or store it in a hold of a cargo ship and fly it across the Void to the construction site.

Then, all you need is to summon the control UI of the workshop, using it deploy the DIY Kit, add it to the construction queue and order the kerbals to work (day and night, no holidays, no weekends!).
